TinyPie is a "library" for plotting pie charts in JavaScript. The reason for the quotation marks is simple, currently the API consists of a single function: TinyPie.piechart([[value1,color1],[value2,color2],..]) which returns an SVG tree containing the pie chart. See demo.xhtml for a demo.

Due to the usage of SVG this library will probably not work correctly in Internet Explorer, but most other reasonably modern browsers should work.

This library was written to scratch an itch. New major features (especially new chart types) will probably not be added. Feel free to fork and modify to your heart's content.
